MatrixPad

A macropad designed in a shape of a industrial radio remote controler. It has six MX-Style switches, one EC11 Rotary encoders, one 0.91 inch OLED display, it's based on the Seeed XIAO RP2040 that uses QMK firmware

It's my first ever project, i had no experience in 3D modeling or making PCB so im quite happy with myself :3
